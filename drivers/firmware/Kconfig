	  TI System Control Interface (TISCI) Message Protocol is used to manage
	  compute systems such as ARM, DSP etc with the system controller in
	  complex System on Chip(SoC) such as those found on certain keystone
	  generation SoC from TI.

	  System controller provides various facilities including power
	  management function support.

	  This protocol library is used by client drivers to use the features
	  provided by the system controller.
