## Simple example

### Preparations
This example uses Ubuntu 14.04. It works on other linux distibutions as well, though you may need to change some package names. See [setting up the environment](https://github.com/tass-belgium/picotcp/wiki/Setting-up-the-environment#prerequisite-packages) for some more info.

```bash
sudo apt-get install git check vde2 libvdeplug2-dev libpcap0.8-dev openvpn wireshark
git clone https://github.com/tass-belgium/picotcp
cd picotcp
make TAP=1
cd ..
```

### The code

Then make a new directory, e.g. `example`, and create a file with the following content : 
[//]: # (The code below is pulled through our CI - please leave the code extractor comments intact!)
[//]: # (code extractor start)
```C
#include <time.h>
#include <pico_stack.h>
#include <pico_ipv4.h>
#include <pico_icmp4.h>
#include <pico_dev_tap.h>

#define NUM_PING 10

static int finished = 0;

/* gets called when the ping receives a reply, or encounters a problem */
void cb_ping(struct pico_icmp4_stats *s)
{
    char host[30];
    pico_ipv4_to_string(host, s->dst.addr);
    if (s->err == 0) {
        /* if all is well, print some pretty info */
        printf("%lu bytes from %s: icmp_req=%lu ttl=%lu time=%lu ms\n", s->size,
                host, s->seq, s->ttl, (long unsigned int)s->time);
        if (s->seq >= NUM_PING)
            finished = 1;
    } else {
        /* if something went wrong, print it and signal we want to stop */
        printf("PING %lu to %s: Error %d\n", s->seq, host, s->err);
        finished = 1;
    }
}


int main(void){
    int id;
    struct pico_ip4 ipaddr, netmask;
    struct pico_device* dev;

    /* initialise the stack. Super important if you don't want ugly stuff like
     * segfaults and such! */
    pico_stack_init();

    /* create the tap device */
    dev = pico_tap_create("tap0");
    if (!dev)
        return -1;

    /* assign the IP address to the tap interface */
    pico_string_to_ipv4("192.168.5.4", &ipaddr.addr);
    pico_string_to_ipv4("255.255.255.0", &netmask.addr);
    pico_ipv4_link_add(dev, ipaddr, netmask);

    printf("starting ping\n");
    id = pico_icmp4_ping("192.168.5.5", NUM_PING, 1000, 10000, 64, cb_ping);

    if (id == -1)
        return -1;

    /* keep running stack ticks to have picoTCP do its network magic. Note that
     * you can do other stuff here as well, or sleep a little. This will impact
     * your network performance, but everything should keep working (provided
     * you don't go overboard with the delays). */
    while (finished != 1)
    {
        usleep(1000);
        pico_stack_tick();
    }

    printf("finished !\n");
    return 0;
}

```

[//]: # (code extractor stop)

### Building and running

Now we can compile this and link it, by running 
```bash
gcc -c -o main.o -I../picotcp/build/include main.c
gcc -o main.elf main.o ../picotcp/build/lib/libpicotcp.a
```

Next we'll create a persistent tap device - a virtual network port. You don't need to repeat this each time, the device will exist until you reboot, or until you go `sudo tunctl -d tap0`
```bash
sudo tunctl -u <username>
sudo ifconfig tap0 192.168.5.5
```

Now, you should be able to run `./main.elf`, and see output like 
```
Protocol ethernet registered (layer: 2).
Protocol ipv4 registered (layer: 3).
Protocol ipv6 registered (layer: 3).
Protocol icmp4 registered (layer: 4).
Protocol icmp6 registered (layer: 4).
Protocol igmp registered (layer: 4).
Protocol udp registered (layer: 4).
Protocol tcp registered (layer: 4).
Device tap0 created.
Assigned ipv4 192.168.5.4 to device tap0
starting ping
64 bytes from 192.168.5.5: icmp_req=1 ttl=64 time=5 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.5.5: icmp_req=2 ttl=64 time=0 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.5.5: icmp_req=3 ttl=64 time=0 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.5.5: icmp_req=4 ttl=64 time=0 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.5.5: icmp_req=5 ttl=64 time=0 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.5.5: icmp_req=6 ttl=64 time=0 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.5.5: icmp_req=7 ttl=64 time=0 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.5.5: icmp_req=8 ttl=64 time=0 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.5.5: icmp_req=9 ttl=64 time=0 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.5.5: icmp_req=10 ttl=64 time=0 ms
finished !
```

While the application is running, you can also run
```
ping 192.168.5.4
```
to send pings in the other direction.

### Investigating what happened

Run wireshark, and sniff the tap0 interface. Then run the `./main.elf` again, and see what happens. You should see an ARP request from picoTCP to Linux, and a reply. After that you should see the ping requests and replies going back and forth.

Note, sometimes you may see lots of other stuff, IPv6 router sollicitations, various broadcasts, mDNS, DNS-SD, etc - this is your when your Linux notices the new network interface is up, and starts all sorts of discoveries. With the persistent TAP device, this usually only happens the first time you start the application. Start a new wireshark capture, and start the application again, it should be much cleaner now.

Now you could make some changes to the `main.c` file, and experiment a bit! Keep some statistics of your pings (max, min, avg time). Open a UDP socket, send some stuff to a netcat instance on your linux. Or build a rudimentary port scanner, see what ports are open on your machine.

Unfortunately we can't release all the code, a.o. because some parts depend on code or binaries that aren't GPL compatible, some parts were developed under a commercial contract, and some consist of very rough proof-of-concept code.
If you want to know more about the availability under the commercial license, or the possibility of using our expert services for porting or driver development, feel free to contact us at info@picotcp.com.
